1)This code written in MATLAB
2)The code is done to defines the constants and parameters used in the heat equation, such as thermal conductivity, density, specific heat capacity. It then defines the time steps and the input heat flux as a function of time. It also defines the spatial grid and initializes the temperature array. Then, it uses a for loop to solve for the temperature at each time step using finite difference method.  It then applies the boundary condition at the surface of TPS and the energy balance at the base of TPS to update the temperature at the next time step.
3)to compile and run  the code 
  a) open the (.m) code in matlab editior and run it .
